Introduction
========================================================


- 1/4 of transgender youth -> at least 1 suicidal attempt (Paterson, Matthews,Copps-Smith & Conard, 2017)

- over 30% -> lifetime suicide attempts (Perez-Brumer, Hatzenbuehler, Oldenburg & Bockting, 2015)

- Transgender people are at high risk for suicide ideation, attempts, and deaths (Wolford-Clavenger, Frantell, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018) 



Methods
========================================================
- H1: Transgender people have higher rates of suicidal thoughts
- Data from Google Trends
- Search for terms "suicide" and " transgender" (as a theme search)
- Correlation between these two terms in the last FIVE years in United States


Proposed Analyses
========================================================
Pearson R correlation (association between trangender and suicide thoughts)
<small> quantitative data from Google Trends with results between 1 and -1</small>
<small> 1 means perfectly possitive correlation and -1 perfectly negative correlation</small>
